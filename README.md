# Chess
The first project is to make an interactive Chess game in the browser using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project will grow as I learn more about the languages to test my skills. Once finished for local play, I plan on learning Node.js and Vue.js to try and make the game playable online versus another player via the browser.
